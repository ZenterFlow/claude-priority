# Plugin Formatter Examples

This directory contains before/after examples demonstrating the plugin-formatter's capabilities.

## Directory Structure

- `before-after/` - Side-by-side comparisons of malformed vs. formatted plugins
- `common-errors/` - Examples of typical errors and how they're fixed
- `validation-reports/` - Sample validation reports generated by the formatter

## Example Scenarios

### 1. Naming Convention Fixes
