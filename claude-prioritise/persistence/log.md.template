# Activity Log

This file tracks all claude-prioritise plugin activity across sessions.

## How This Works
- Each time you run "What should I work on?" or "Show project status", an entry is added
- Entries are timestamped and include context about what you were working on
- This helps maintain continuity across sessions
- The log is automatically trimmed to keep the most recent 100 entries
