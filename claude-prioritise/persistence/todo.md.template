# Current Tasks

This file tracks the current state of your tasks.

## How This Works
- Tasks are synced from ideas.md automatically
- Move tasks between sections as you work on them
- Use checkboxes [ ] and [x] or the section headers to indicate status
- The plugin reads this file to generate status reports and suggestions

---

## Done ✅
<!-- Completed tasks - celebrate your wins! -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - [x] Set up project structure -->
<!-- - [x] Configure development environment -->

## In Progress 🔄
<!-- Tasks you're currently working on - keep this focused (1-3 items max) -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - [ ] 🔄 Implement user authentication -->
<!-- - [ ] 🔄 Write unit tests for API endpoints -->

## Not Started 📋
<!-- Tasks from your backlog that are ready to work on -->
<!-- These are automatically synced from ideas.md based on priority -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - [ ] 📋 Add error handling to async functions -->
<!-- - [ ] 📋 Create documentation for new API -->
<!-- - [ ] 📋 Set up CI/CD pipeline -->

<!-- Tips: -->
<!-- - Keep "In Progress" small to maintain focus -->
<!-- - Move items to "Done" when complete (feels good!) -->
<!-- - Don't worry about adding tasks manually - they sync from ideas.md -->
<!-- - Use the plugin to get smart suggestions about what to work on next -->
