# Backlog Ideas

This file contains your project backlog organized by priority.

## How to Use
1. Add ideas to the appropriate priority section
2. Use markdown bullets (- )
3. Add context tags like [DUE: date] or [URGENT] if needed
4. Ideas are automatically synced to todo.md when you run status checks
5. Mark completed items with ~~strikethrough~~ or move them to todo.md Done section
